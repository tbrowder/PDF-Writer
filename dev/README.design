The two modes are:

+ verbatim or text mode

  - see previous PostScript work, but use PDF modules

+ word processing or typesetting

  - use pod as markup input
  - input is assumed to be all pod
    (=begin/=end pod lines are not
     required but any :config keys on the =begin
     will be retained); using more than one
     pair of the lines is an error
  - input will be split into chunks 
    for further processing
    + chunks will be vertical nodes (class DocNode)
      on a single page until final
      pagination









    + identify specific markup to be handled
      at each stage
    + convert each pod node to a class or node
    + a tree of parent and child nodes
    

  - identify config settings

  - write a pod doc as a test input; it should
    include a complete set of desired inputs
    to handle non-mathematical text
