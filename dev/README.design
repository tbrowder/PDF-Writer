The two modes are:

+ verbatim or text mode

  - see previous PostScript work, but use PDF modules

+ word processing or typesetting

  - use pod as markup input
    + identify specific markup to be handled
      at each stage
    + convert each pod node to a class or node
    + a tree of parent and child nodes
    

  - identify config settings

  - write a pod doc as a test input; it should
    include a complete set of desired inputs
    to handle non-mathematical text
