Make a base class that has fundamental attributes to be shared by most
other PostScript objects.

A document input file is expected to be one of two types:

  1. source code where each line must retain its content, although the
     line may be wrapped as many times as necessary and with an
     explicit mareker to indicate that fact, and a monospaced font is
     used.

  2. text that consists of paragraphs separated by one or more blank
     lines with a propotional font, allow for kerning, and allow for a
     limited set of in-line text formatting commands

Lines may be numbered in either type.

The input file is assumed to be source code unless the '-w' option
(word processing) is used.

A source code file is not checked for any special characters with one
exception: parentheses, of either side, will be escaped for PostScript
use.
