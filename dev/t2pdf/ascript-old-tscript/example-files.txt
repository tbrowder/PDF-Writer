# For all files:

# Note all text in any input file on a line from a '#' (pound or hash
# symbol, formally: octothorp) is ignored as are all blank lines.

# Year conversions:
#   {1999}  <= year number in curly braces results in a cardinal
#              number (1, 2, etc.)
#   [1999]  <= year number in square brackets results in an ordinal
#              number (1st, 2nd, etc.)

# There are three types of input files for users:
#   1. event files:
#        'birthdays.txt'
#        'anniversaries.txt'
#        'other-events.txt'
#
#   These files have an event on a single line in one of the following
#     three formats:
#        day month text.... 
#        day month text.... [yyyy]
#        day month text.... {yyyy}
#
#     where 'day' is the day of the month (1..31), 'month' is the
#     standard three-letter abbreviation of the month of the year
#     (jan...dec), and 'yyyy' is the optional year of the originsl
#     event (birth, wedding, etc.) if you want to
#     see the number of years since the original event.
#     The month abbreviations are not case-sensitive.
#     Empty year brackets will be ignored, but a missing part
#     of either pair will be an error. Note neither character
#     is allowed in the preceding text; otherwise, there
#     is no limitation for the text portion.
#
#   2. other data
#        'front-cover-words.txt'
#        'monthly-quotes.txt'
#=============================================================
# File: birthdays.txt
# File: anniversaries.txt
# File: other-events.txt
#=============================================================

# These files contains entries for birthdays, anniversaries, or
# other events for the personalized wall calendar. The only 
# difference in the three files is in the formatting and color
# on the calendar. See the example calendar for details. For any 
# event realize too much data will overflow and ruin the final
# appearance.

#=============================================================
# File: monthly-quotes.txt
#=============================================================
# This file contains monthly quotations for the personalized wall
# calendar (there must be exactly 12 lines, one for each month).
# Note that the quotations are one per line and the longest one (122
# characters) is as long as my calendar format can handle (one printed
# line).  Note also that they are printed on each sheet in top to
# bottom order from January through December.

# The following Bible verses are from the King James Version (KJV).
# They were chosen by my dear late mother-in-law, Grace Lee, who was 
# the person for whom I started this program near the end of the
# last century. They are used by default. If you do not want them,
# merely provide an empty 'monthly-quotes.txt' file with your
# other input files.
